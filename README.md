Different types of analysis carried out for the two projects are detailed below:
- Data Analytic Platform for the ***University Canada West***
- Data Analytic Platform for the ***City of Vancouver***
 
## [Project 1: Data Analytic Platform for the University Canada West](University_Canada_West/README.md)

### *Background:*
The University Canada West is an Educative Institution focus on provide high-quality eduction for which gathering, collecting and storing information generated from it operational activities is essencial to obtain statistics. However, all this data needs to be processed in ordert to obtain valuable insights that allows the UCW keep maintaing it high-quality education.
